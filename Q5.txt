When you insert, update, or delete data that violates a constraint, the database rejects the operation and returns an error. This protects data integrity.

Consequences of Violating Constraints:
Insert: Inserting NULL into a NOT NULL column → Error

Update: Changing a value to a duplicate in a UNIQUE column → Error

Delete: Deleting a row referenced by a FOREIGN KEY → Error

Example
ERROR:  null value in column "emp_name" violates not-null constraint
DETAIL:  Failing row contains (101, null, 25, john@example.com, 30000).
